🚀 Power BI Project: SN Corp Sales Dashboard 📊

I am excited to share my latest data visualization project using Power BI, where I analyzed and visualized the sales performance for SN Corp from 2017 to 2020.

Key highlights of the dashboard:

📈 Sales Analysis: Achieved a total sales of $1.26M, with a total profit of $627K across various product categories like Bookcases, Chairs, Appliances, Copiers, and Storage.
🌍 Regional Insights: Visualized sales distribution by region, with 55% from Central, 22% from North, and 23% from South, helping identify key areas of growth.
📦 Order Trends: Explored order volumes over time, broken down by quarters and years, showcasing how sales evolved.
🛠 Cost vs. Profit: Provided a detailed breakdown of sales, cost, and profit per customer, helping pinpoint high-value customers such as Zachary Warner and Zona Meyer.
This interactive dashboard allows for filtering by shipping mode, region, and product category, providing a 360° view of the company’s performance.

Skills utilized: Data wrangling, DAX formulas, and advanced Power BI visualization techniques.
